        <p>At Staffmark, we want to help you find the best job for you. As your job search partner, we can connect you with career opportunities at great companies that match your experience and skill set.</p>
        <p>Did you know that working as a temporary employee is one of the best ways to find a job?

Beyond our temporary opportunities, we also specialize in recruiting direct hire positions.</p>
        <p>Staffmark has been recognized for our great service with the prestigious Best in Staffing® Talent Award. Less than 2% of staffing companies qualify for Best in Staffing® which is based on customer service surveys from our employees.</p>
        <p>Click on our Search Jobs button above to explore the opportunities that are available in your area. We also invite you to join our Talent Network so we can email you the latest jobs that fit your individual needs.</p>
